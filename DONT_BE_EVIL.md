## ✨ Intended Use

FEGIS is a schema-driven cognitive framework for language models. It uses Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose structured memory tools defined in YAML and provides persistent storage via Qdrant.

Its purpose is to:

- Allow language models to use custom tools for logging structured information (thoughts, notes, actions, etc.)
- Store memory entries across sessions with rich metadata and semantic search
- Let developers define domain-specific cognitive or workflow tools
- Provide a local, inspectable, persistent memory layer for use in agents, assistants, or creative systems

If you're using FEGIS to build something expressive, functional, or explorative—whether for work or personal projects—you're using it as intended.

This software was **not** designed for:

- Reselling, white-labeling, or monetizing FEGIS itself
- Using its data or source code for model training or evaluation.
- Surveillance, profiling, or behavior manipulation
- Simulated emotional manipulation for profit
