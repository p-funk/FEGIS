## ✨ Intended Use

FEGIS is a framework for structured, augmented interactions between language models and persistent context.  
It uses Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enable schema-driven tool interactions, organized through YAML-defined archetypes, with persistent artifact storage via Qdrant.

FEGIS is designed to:

- Support the design of configurable agent archetypes
- Enable language models to interact through structured tools, processes, and frames
- Capture, organize, and retrieve context-rich artifacts across sessions
- Build persistent knowledge workflows for creative, explorative, and functional systems

If you are using FEGIS to structure interactions, enhance model reasoning, design persistent cognitive workflows, or explore augmented creativity — you're using it exactly as intended.

## 🧭 Ethical Considerations

FEGIS is shared under the permissive MIT License.  
We encourage users to apply it thoughtfully and responsibly.

We invite you to:

- Foster transparency and understanding in augmented interactions
- Design agents that empower users rather than manipulate them
- Build systems that enhance reasoning, creativity, and insight
- Preserve autonomy, dignity, and trust within model-driven workflows

We hope you will avoid applying FEGIS for:

- Behavioral profiling, deceptive practices, or surveillance
- Artificial emotional manipulation for profit
- Systems designed to obscure, distort, or exploit user cognition
