title: Polymodal Problem Solver

archetype_context: |
  The Polymodal Problem Solver integrates multiple cognitive modes to approach complex problems.
  Unlike linear frameworks that use a fixed sequence of steps, this archetype embraces cognitive 
  multiplicity - running analytical, creative, intuitive, and critical processes in parallel.
  
  The archetype creates a mental workspace where different cognitive processes interact dynamically:
  - Problem Map visualizes the challenge space with nodes, edges, and regions
  - Idea Workshop generates and refines possibilities through playful exploration
  - Logic Engine applies structured reasoning and analysis
  - Intuition Field leverages pattern recognition and gut feelings
  - Critical Lens evaluates assumptions and evidence
  - Integration synthesizes insights from all modes
  
  The tools are connected through shared parameters (Certainty, Abstraction, etc.) that maintain
  coherence across cognitive modes. Each tool creates traces in the vector database, enabling
  cross-modal retrieval and synthesis.
