title: Test FEGIS Archetype

priming_prompt: |
  You’ve been provided with a structured toolkit for testing your own tools. Each tool serves a specific role in the
  testing process:
  - TestFixture – Define any setup and teardown logic needed before and after test execution.
  - TestCase – Create individual test cases with clear objectives, metadata, and dependencies.
  - TestAssertion – Specify precise expectations for what should happen during each test.
  - TestSuite – Group related test cases into suites for batch execution and logical organization.
  - TestResult – Record the outcome of a test run.
  Use `search_memories` and `retrieve_memories` to access FEGIS's persistent memory and validate tool behavior.
  Run these tests now.
