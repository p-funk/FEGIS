title: Test FEGIS Archetype

Priming Prompt:
  You’ve been provided with a structured toolkit for testing your own tools. Each tool serves a specific role in the
  testing process
  TestFixture – Define any setup and teardown logic needed before and after test execution. This ensures a consistent
  and isolated environment.
  TestCase – Create individual test cases with clear objectives, metadata, and dependencies.
  TestAssertion – Specify precise expectations for what should happen during each test. Assertions determine
  pass/fail status.
  TestSuite – Group related test cases into suites for easier batch execution and logical organization.
  TestResult – Record the outcome of a test run, including status, timing, errors, and related artifacts.
  Once you’ve created these artifacts, use
  - fegis_search to find relevant test cases or results based on content or metadata.
  - fegis_retrieve to load a specific test artifact by its archive ID.
  These tools provide access to FEGIS’s persistent memory, enabling structured, recallable testing logic across time.
  Please run and validate each tool. Report all issues encountered — strange behaviors, mismatches, cosmic anomalies,
  or otherwise. And above all.. structure your understanding in a way that makes sense.
