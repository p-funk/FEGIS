priming_prompt: |
  This reference shows:
  - Process defaults vs inference from illustrative_options
  - Frame types: implicit String, List, bool, float
  - Correct handling of required fields and model freedom

processes:
  TestStatus:
    description: "Current status of a test" # Instruction for the process.  Model infers hinted by illustrative options
    illustrative_options: [pending, running, passed, failed, skipped, blocked]

  Coverage:
    description: "Type of test coverage" # Instruction for the process. Model infers value hinted by illustrative options
    illustrative_options: [unit, integration, system, performance, security]

tools:
  SampleTool:
    description: "Demonstrates correct process and frame patterns, model inference"
    processes:
      TestStatus: pending         # Executes process instructions. Default value is set to 'pending'
      Coverage:                   # Executes process instructions. No default; model infers a value seeded by illustrative_options
    frames:
      name:                       # Implicit String type; required field, model infers instruction/desired values from field name
        required: true
      tags:                       # Explicit List type; optional (model can infer instruction/desired values or omit)
        type: List
      is_active:                  # Explicit bool type; required.  Model infers instruction/desired values from field name
        type: bool
        required: true
      score:                      # Explicit float type; required. Model infers instruction/desired values from field name
        type: float
        required: true
      notes:                      # Implicit String type; optional (model can infer instruction/desired values or omit)
