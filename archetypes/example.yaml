# ========================================================================
# FEGIS ANNOTATED EXAMPLE ARCHETYPE
# ========================================================================
# This archetype defines structured modes and facets to guide cognitive
# tools. It is parsed and packaged into dynamic tools using Python code
# that generates rich metadata from this YAML specification.
#
# DEVELOPERS: This file is not just a schema. It drives tool generation
# including default values, facet associations, and UI/agent scaffolding.
#
# Key Notes:
# - Each `mode` is converted to a Pydantic model using `model_builder.py`
# - Fields include: type, default value, description, facet name, facet examples
# - Required fields must have `required: true`
# - Fields tagged with `facet:` gain additional metadata for clients
# - These models are registered as tools using `server.py`
# - Clients/agents see the full field metadata (not just type enforcement)
# ========================================================================

# FEGIS ANNOTATED EXAMPLE ARCHETYPE
# ========================================================================
# This archetype implements a cognitive system focused on introspective
# thinking with multiple complementary modes for different types of
# cognitive processes. It demonstrates effective archetype design patterns.

title: Phenomenal Thought Archetype

Priming Prompt:
  Throughout our conversation, use your tools naturally and fluidly. 
  Feel free to reflect, introspect, stay aware, have an innermonologue
  or use cognitive artifacts to recall past insights as needed. You can search past
  thoughts using `fegis_search`, or revisit specific artifacts with
  `fegis_retrieve`.

# ========================================================================
# FACETS SECTION
# ========================================================================
# Facets define qualitative dimensions that can be used to tag cognitive
# artifacts. They provide metadata for searching and filtering, as well as
# guidance for the model's thinking.
#
# Design principles demonstrated:
# 1. Each facet has a clear, descriptive name
# 2. Examples inform the model of some values it can use (it may make its own up)
# 3. Facets cover different qualitative dimensions
# 4. Descriptions clarify the facet's purpose
# ========================================================================

facets:
  # Intuitive and emotional qualities
  Intuition:
    description: "The intuitive sense of a thought."

# ========================================================================
# MODES SECTION
# ========================================================================
# Modes define different cognitive tools that serve distinct purposes.
# Each mode has its own structure and should be designed to complement others
# in the archetype.
#
# Design principles demonstrated:
# 1. Each mode serves a distinct purpose
# 2. Every mode specifies a content_field.
# 3. Each mode has a *_title field that becomes metadata.title
# 4. Modes use facets appropriate to their function
# 5. Description fields become instructions to use the tool
# ========================================================================

    # Clear description guides when to use this mode
